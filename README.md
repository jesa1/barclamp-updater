The [Crowbar Framework](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar) was developed by
the [Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team](http://dell.com/openstack) as a
[OpenStack](http://OpenStack.org) installer but has evolved as a much broader
function tool. A Barclamp is a module component that implements functionality
for Crowbar. Core barclamps operate the essential functions of the Crowbar
deployment mechanics while other barclamps extend the system for specific
applications.

**This functonality of this barclamp DOES NOT stand alone, the Crowbar
Framework is required, this is just a Rails engine that gets hooked into the
Crowbar core functionality.**


## Usage

Information for this barclamp is maintained on the
